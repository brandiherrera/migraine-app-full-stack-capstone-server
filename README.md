# My-Brain Tracker Server

This migraine app allows users to record their migraines along with details of the migraine. Users can view their records over time to find common symptoms and remedies, in addition to their highest occurring statistics. They can also share their findings with healthcare professionals so they may find a suitable treatment moving forward.
