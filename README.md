# Migraine App Server

This migraine app allows users to log their migraines along with details of the migraine. Users can view their logs over time to find common symptoms and remedies, and they can also share with healthcare professionals so they may find a suitable treatment moving forward.

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.
